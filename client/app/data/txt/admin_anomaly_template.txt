Dear Globaleaks Node Administrator,
We have a problem (or an opportunity, up to you).

Something in your GlobaLeaks Node is triggering an unexpected activity.

Maybe is a flood, maybe your whistleblowing initiatiative has attracted visibility.

Activities:

Alarm level: %ActivityAlarmLevel%
%ActivityDump%

Disk space:

Alarm level: %DiskAlarmLevel%
%DiskDump%

for more info, login in your Administration panel and check on Stats and Anomalies.
