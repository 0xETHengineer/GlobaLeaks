          {
            VALUE[0]: {
              "text": LOCALIZED_DICT[0],
              "trigger": ID_OF_FIELD
            }
            VALUE[1]: {
              "text": LOCALIZED_DICT[1],
              "trigger": null
            }
          }

      For modal the format is:
          {
            "title": LOCALIZED_DICT,
            "body": LOCALIZED_DICT,
            "link": LINK
          }

      For the dialog the format is:

          {
            "title": LOCALIZED_DICT,
            "body": LOCALIZED_DICT
          }

      For the tos the format is:
          
          {
            "body": LOCALIZED_DICT
          }

      For the group the format is:

          {
            "fields":
                contains a list of fields in the format that is defined above
          }

}
```

The format of the step data format is as follows:

```
{
  "name": LOCALIZED_DICT,
  "fields": 
      list of fields as defined above
}
```

What will be returned by the `/fields` API is a list of steps.
