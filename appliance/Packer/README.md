# GlobaLeaks Packer Script

[Packer](http://www.packer.io/) is a tool for building identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration.

This can be used for example in order to:

* automatically build GlobaLeaks VirtualBox images;
* automatically build Globaleaks VMware Images;
* and deploy GlobaLeaks even on Cloud Services (AMIs EC2, ..)!
