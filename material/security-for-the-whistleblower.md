# Security for the Whistleblower

SCOPE-1: This page will go on the initiative website and on the landing page of
a submission.

When submitting sensitive information you must be aware of and consider the
risks involved. By blowing the whistle you should be aware of the fact that you
may be subject to retaliation by parties that don't like the fact that you are
bringing the truth to light.

For this reason you must take all the possible actions to preserve your
anonymity.

You need to be aware of the social and technical risks and take the right
countermeasures to protect yourself. The most applicable protection strategies
depend on the scenario, especially those related to social risks.

## Social Risks

Before submitting any information you should consider what will happen “after”
the information has been sent and news about the related facts reaches public
media attention.

Ask yourself these questions to understand your real risk context:

1. Are you the only person or one of the few people that has access to the
information you are interested in submitting?

2. After the information reaches public attention, do know if someone will ask
you something about it?

3. Do you feel capable of managing the “stress” of an internal or external
investigation (someone asking you lot's of questions) about the submission?

Only after you fully understand and have properly reflected on the previous
points, you should consider submitting to a GlobaLeaks site.

## Social Protection

From a social protection perspective you should take at least the following set
of actions:

1. Before you make a submission, don't tell your intention to anyone.

2. After you make a submission, don't tell what you have done to anyone.

3. After the news about the submission gets out to public media, be really
careful in expressing your opinion about it with anyone.

4. Be sure that there's no surveillance systems (cameras or other) in the place
where you acquire and submit the information.

5. Don't look around on search engines or news media website for the
information you submitted (this would reveal that you knew about it earlier).

These are just a set of the social protection actions that you must should consider.

## Technological Risks

You must be aware of the fact that while using a computer and the internet to
exchange information, most of the actions you do leave traces (computer logs)
that could lead an investigator to identifying where you are and who you are.

For this reason you must take very specific precautions and risk mitigation
strategies to avoid leaving technological traces about your actions.

You may leave digital traces while doing the following actions:

1. Researching on the information to be submitted.

2. Acquiring the information to be submitted.

3. Reading this web page.

4. Submitting the information to a globaleaks site.

5. Exchanging data with the receivers of your submission.

All these actions may leave traces completely waiving your security, but with
few technological protection steps you can minimize the risks.

## Technological Protection

Technological protection actions could be the most tricky to understand due
to the underlying technical complexity of today's computing and network
systems.

To achieve a 100% guarantee of security from technical perspective you need to
be computer-proficient enough to fully understand all the risks.

However by strictly following the procedures and tips reported below you should
be safe enough:

1. Submit information using Anonymous Web Browsing software
[Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/download/download) (it’s easy, use it!).

2. Don’t submit information from the personal computer provided to you by your
employer (consider using a spare one or buying one with cash for this purpose).

3. Keep the Submission's receipt safe and destroy it after you don't need it
anymore.

4. Don't keep a copy of the information you submitted if not encrypted and
properly hidden.

5. While acquiring the information to be submitted, be sure that there's no
traces being left on the IT systems leading back to your identity. For example
if you use a personal USB key (that in the past contained some of your personal
files) to collect the data to leak a forensics analysis could link your personal
files to the leaked material (when you delete files from a USB disk they are not
actually deleted).

6. Be ware of the fact that "meta data information" may be present in some of
the data you are submitting.

7. Consider cleaning up the Metadata by using tools such as MAT bundled with
the TAILS linux live CD.

8. Consider converting all the data that you are sending us to standard PDF
format

By applying the procedures describe above you should be safe enough.

Safe enough doesn't means 100% safe.

To overall improve your digital security you should undergo reading the
[Security in a Box project](https://securityinabox.org/), explaining most of
the risks and related countermeasures.
