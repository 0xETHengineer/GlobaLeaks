### VERSION-A:

When making a submission you should be aware that it can be done with a
different degree of protection of your identity.  You are about to upload your
tip over a https/ssl protected connection.  This means that your are not
anonymous, but your content is encrypted.  There have been instances where
https/ssl encryption has been broken: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar If
you are about to give a tip concerning strong adversaries such as nation
states, secret services or the military, or if you want to be anonymous, you
should use Tor to upload your tip.

### VERSION-B:

Is possible to make confidential or anonymous submission.

With Confidential Submission you are exposing yourself to the risks that
someone else* will know that you have submitted something, without knowing what
you have submitted. 

Instead with Anonymous Submission you are fully protected, is not even possible
for a third party to know that you have submitted something.

We strongly advise you to go with Anonymous Submission.

To make Anonymous Submission, instead of your usual Web Browser (Internet
Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Etc) you should use the Tor Browser Bundle,
thatâ€™s a special software designed to enable Anonymous Web Browsing. 

* "someone else" is someone who is actively against the whistleblowers activity
  or the initiative, using technological or physical ways. It maybe your
  employe, his private investigator, the security authorities of your
  countries, etc, etc.
