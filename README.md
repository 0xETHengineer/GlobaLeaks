# GlobaLeaks

![GlobaLeaks](http://globaleaks.org/images/logo.png)

GlobaLeaks is a project aimed at creating a whistleblowing platform built on FLOSS.

This is the main repository that serves to keep track of the overall
development of the GlobaLeaks platform as a whole.

Here we collect all the knowledge that is not specific to the client or backend
component.

## GlobaLeaks 0.1

This is the first implementation of the GlobaLeaks workflow.

People interested in installing and running a GlobaLeaks node *now* should look
into running [GlobaLeaks 0.1](https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks-0.1.git).

GlobaLeaks 0.1 is an "Adanced Prototype" and it has helped us understand the
limits of certain technological choices and lead us towards the new branch of
development.

We will keep maintaining GlobaLeaks 0.1 and make migrating to GlobaLeaks 0.2 as
seamless as possible, but it is not the main direction of development.

## GlobaLeaks 0.2

This is a full rewrite and it collects all of the experience and knowledge
gained in building GlobaLeaks 0.1.

To learn how to setup your own GlobaLeaks, look at [Globaleaks Wiki documentation] (https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki/Home)

All future development will continue in this direction. The complete [Project Plan](http://globaleaks.org/ProjectPlan.pdf).pdf describes the goal without technical details.

The main components of GlobaLeaks 0.2 are
[GLClient](https://github.com/globaleaks/GLClient.git) and
[GLBackend](https://github.com/globaleaks/GLBackend.git).

[GLClient](https://github.com/globaleaks/GLClient.git) is a javascript web
application that communicates to the [GLBackend](https://github.com/globaleaks/GLBackend.git), the backend component of GlobaLeaks.
