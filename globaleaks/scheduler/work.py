    WorkManager is a queue driven job scheduler. You can add jobs to it

    intervals.

    Every time it starts going through the job queue it writes it's state. When
    it has finished iterating over the jobs and starting them it will write the
    state again.

    This allows it to resume state across restarts.

    retries: through this parameter you can specify a list of intervals after
    which a retry should happen. This is time in seconds.
