Actually I've got some problems in using those scheduler,

jobs_base was the previously know jobs/base.py file

At the moment those file are not used, and the scheduler is provided by the standard python
apscheduler (http://packages.python.org/APScheduler/modules/scheduler.html) It's pretty good,
support all the feature we need, and works without problem.
