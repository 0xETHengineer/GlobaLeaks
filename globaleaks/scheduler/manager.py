    WorkManager is a queue driven job scheduler. You can add jobs to it
    and it will schedule them for execution.
    It handles errors by scheduling retries at a series of specified
    intervals.

    Every time it starts going through the job queue it writes it's state. When
    it has finished iterating over the jobs and starting them it will write the
    state again.

    This allows it to resume state across restarts.

    WARNING API CHANGE:
    the retries parameter is now part of Job.
