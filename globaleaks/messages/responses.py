"""
Here should go the functions for generating the responses to be sent by a
GLBackend to a GLClient.

XXX
Initially we were thinking of doing sanitization of data in input and in ouput,
but I believe that since the client must be hostproof in the sense that if it
is purely client side loaded it should be responsible for sanitizing and
validating the messages that come in. For this reason I believe we should only
put here helper functions that are useful for generating complex responses, but
we should not worry about making sure the types of them are valid since we
already do validation on the input side.
