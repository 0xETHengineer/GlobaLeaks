"""
In here we have all of the models that create an object relational link with
their database representation.

A few things on naming convention.
__storm_table__ is the table name and it should be plural (with an s)
The name of the class starts with a capital letter and uses camel case and is
singular (no s).

The names of the modules is singular with no s
