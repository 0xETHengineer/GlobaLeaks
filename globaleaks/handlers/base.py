    GLBackendHandler is responsible for the verification and sanitization of
    requests based on what is defined in the API specification (api.py).

    I will take care of instantiating models classes that will generate for me
    output to be sent to GLClient.

    Keep in mind the following gotchas:

    When you decorate a handler with @inlineCallbacks or are returning a
    deferred be sure to decorate it also with @asynchronous (order does not
    matter).

    Operations on objects should go inside of models, because in here it is not
    possible to instantiate a Store object without blocking.

    Messages can be validated with messages.validateMessage. This will output
    the validated message.

    An example usage:
        request = message.validateMessage(self.request.body,
                            message.requests.submissionStatus)

    Request is now a dict that I can interact with.
